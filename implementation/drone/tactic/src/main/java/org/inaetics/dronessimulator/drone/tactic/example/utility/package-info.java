/**
 * This package contains an example tactic that uses a utility function. In the package messages there are the messages that are send between the drones. Note that
 * drones are only able to receive TacticMessages. This contains a Map with String key-value pairs. The CalculateUtilityHelper does the actual utility calculations so
 * you could copy the whole package to your own package and modify only that class.
